# Bit shifting (bitwise operator)

Bit shifting is an operation done on all the bits of a binary value in which they are moved by a determined number of places to either the left or right. Bit shifting is used when the operand is being used as a series of bits rather than as a whole. In other words, the operand is treated as individual bits that stand for something and not as a value.

Bit shifting is often used in programming and has at least one variation in each programming language.

Bit shifting may also be known as a bitwise operation.
